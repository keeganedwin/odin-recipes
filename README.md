A recipes file for the Odin Project

--
It is my 2nd attempt in coding a HTML page; for practice purposes.

--Description--
I used the following site: https://www.simplyrecipes.com/ to find the following recipes.

Quesadilla was the first. The HTML contains a title with a brief description of the recipe.
It's ingredients are then listed (unordered list) followed by the steps (listed list) with their respective text and images.
  This file did have two links added in the one of the steps.

I went for Tiramisu next. Same process as the previous file. A title with a brief description of the recipe.
It's ingredients are then listed (unordered list) followed by the steps (listed list) with their respective text and images.

I went for a Dry-Brinned Roast Chicken as the last recipe; followed the same structure as the previous two.
  This file had one link within the steps to a mixer product.

I had forgotten to create a directory for images for this project and thus realised this only towards the end and did make one.

    <p>Dry-brined roasted chickens are the best way to get succulent, juicy meat, and crispy, golden skin! The best part? You only need 5 minutes and some space in the fridge!</p>

    <h2>Ingredient:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (5 to 6) pound chicken</li>
      <li>1 lemon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 3/4 teaspoons (14g) kosher salt (we used Morton's; see recipe note if using another salt) </li>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons freshly cracked pepper </li>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the pan: </li>
      <p>Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a baking rack on <br> top or use a roasting pan with a roasting rack. </p>

      <li>Make the spice rub: </li>
      <p>Zest and quarter the lemon. Combine the lemon zest, juice from <br> 1/4 of the lemon, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, <br> pepper and thyme together in a small bowl. </p>
      <p>Save the lemon quarters (even the one you squeezed dry) to <br> insert into the cavity. </p>

      <li>Season the chicken: </li>
      <p>Pat the outside of the chicken dry with a paper towel. Slide your <br> fingers between the skin and the breast meat to loosen the <br> skin. Try to separate the skin from around the legs as well. </p>
      <p>Rub 3/4 of the spice mixture under the skin and into the breast <br> and leg meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture inside the cavity <br> of the bird. Insert the lemon quarters in the cavity. </p>

      <li>Truss the chicken: </li>
      <p> To truss the chicken, cut a piece of kitchen twine about 15 <br> inches long. Tuck the wings under the bird as best you can. <br> Center the twine under the back end of the chicken so equal <br> lengths of twine are where you tucked the wings in.</p>
      <p>Lift up each side of the twine crossing it over the top of bird’s <br> body, wrap it around the legs. Tie the legs together. </p>

      <li>Let the chicken air dry for 24 hours: </li>
      <p>Place the bird, baking sheet and all, into your refrigerator <br> uncovered for 24 to 72 hours. If you don’t have the room in your <br> refrigerator it’s ok to put the chicken on a plate and transfer it to <br> the baking sheet when you’re ready to roast the bird. </p>

      <li>Prepare the oven: </li>
      <p>When ready to roast, move your oven rack to the second lowest <br> spot in the oven. Preheat the oven to 375° F degrees. </p>

      <li>Add extra seasonings: </li>
      <p>The chicken will look a little desiccated after the 24-72 hour <br> rest. That’s a good thing! It means your chicken will have crispy <br> skin! </p>
      <p>Transfer the baking sheet from the fridge to the counter. Rub <br> the outside of the chicken with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, a 1/4 <br> teaspoon of kosher salt, and a few cracks of fresh ground <br> pepper. </p>

      <li>Roast and baste the chicken: </li>
      <p>Place the baking sheet into the oven and roast for 1 hour at <br> 375° F degrees. Then turn the oven up to 425° F degrees for the <br> remaining 20 minutes or until the temperature in the thickest <br> part of the breast reaches 160° F degrees. </p>
      <p>Check the chicken at the 45-minute mark and baste it. You may <rb></rb> have to tip the pan a little to the corner to get to the juices. If <br> you don’t have a baster don’t worry, just use a long-handled <br> spoon to scoop up and pour the drippings over the chicken. </p>
      <p>Continue to baste every 15 to 20 minutes until it reaches a <br> deep, rich, golden color, the skin is crispy, and the chicken has <br> finished cooking through. </p>

      <li>Rest the chicken: </li>
      <p>Remove the chicken from the oven when the <br> temperature in the thickest part of the breast reads about 160°F. Let it rest for 5 <br> minutes. The temperature will continue to rise to reach 165°F. </p>
      <p>If you don’t have a thermometer that’s ok. The chicken is <br> cooked through when you slice into it and the juices run clear. </p>

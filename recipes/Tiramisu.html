    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 large egg yolks </li>
      <li>1 cup (200g) sugar, divided</li>
      <li>3 ounces (6 tablespoons) dark rum, divided</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) mascarpone cheese, cold from the fridge</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream, cold from the fridge</li>
      <li>1 cup boiling water </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder </li>
      <li>1 (7-ounce) package ladyfingers</li>
      <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-processed) for dusting the top</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>Prep the dish:</li>
        <p>Lightly oil an 8x8-inch baking dish. </p>
      <li>Whisk the yolks and sugar to make the zabaglione: </li>
        <p>Set a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water to <br> create a double boiler (the bowl should rest on the rim of the <br> pan and the bottom should not touch the surface of the water). </p>
        <p>Whisk together the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of the <br> sugar in the bowl. Continue whisking until the <br> sugar has dissolved, the mixture has increased slightly in volume, and it looks light <br> yellow color. Not sure? Rub a little of the mixture between two fingers (it will be warm, but not too hot to touch) – it should feel <br> smooth and silky; if you feel any sugar granules, keep whisking. </p>

      <li>Add in the rum:</li>
      <p>Gradually whisk in 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the rum and <br> continue whisking rapidly over the double boiler for about 10 <br> minutes, until the mixture is thick, foamy, and very pale yellow. <br> (You can also use a <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/best-hand-mixers-5119826" type="_blank">hand mixer</a> for this step, if you prefer.) </p>
      <p>Remove the bowl from the double boiler and set aside until <br> cooled to at least 90°F or room temperature. </p>

      <li>Whip the mascarpone and cream:</li>
      <p>you can use either a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk <br> attachment for this step. If using a stand mixer, be very <br> attentive and do not walk away while the mascarpone is <br> whipping. Stand mixers are so powerful, that it's easy to <br> overwhip, which causes the mascarpone to separate. You have <br> a little more wiggle room with a hand mixer.</p>
      <p> With a hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk <br> attachment, beat the mascarpone on medium speed for 15 to <br> 30 seconds, until it smooths out and softens. Be careful not to <br> over-beat or else the mascarpone will separate and become <br> grainy.</p>
      <p>With the mixer still on medium speed, gradually add the cream <br> in a thin, slow stream until it's all incorporated. This should take <br> 1 to 2 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl. Continue beating with the mixer on medium-high speed for <br> another 30 to 60 seconds, until the mixture holds firm, not- <br> quite-stiff peaks. </p>

      <li>Mix the whipped cream and the zabaglione: </li>
      <p>Fold 1/3 of the whipped cream into the zabaglione to lighten it, <br> then fold in the remaining whipped cream. </p>

      <li>Make the coffee dipping liquid for the ladyfingers: </li>
      <p>In a wide, shallow dish, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with <br> the remaining 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of rum, the boiling water, <br> and the espresso powder. Stir to dissolve the sugar and <br> espresso. </p>

      <li>Assemble the tiramisu: </li>
      <p>Dunk one ladyfinger at a time in the espresso liquid, turning it <br> so that all sides are evenly moistened — a quick dunk is all you <br> need; any more and the ladyfingers start to disintegrate. <br> Arrange the dunked ladyfingers in rows on the <br> bottom of the baking dish. </p>
      <p>Once you finish the layer, spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture <br> over the top. Repeat dunking and arranging a second layer, and <br> spread the remaining mascarpone over top. </p>

      <li>Chill the tiramisu: </li>
      <p>Cover the tiramisu and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to <br> 24 hours to give the tiramisu time to firm up and for the <br> ladyfingers to soften. </p>

      <li>Serve: </li>
      <p>Dust with cocoa before serving. Serve in wedges directly from <br> the pan. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. </p>

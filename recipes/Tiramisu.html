    <h2>Ingerdients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 large egg yolks </li>
      <li>1 cup (200g) sugar, divided</li>
      <li>3 ounces (6 tablespoons) dark rum, divided</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) mascarpone cheese, cold from the fridge</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream, cold from the fridge</li>
      <li>1 cup boiling water </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder </li>
      <li>1 (7-ounce) package ladyfingers</li>
      <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-processed) for dusting the top</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>Prep the dish:</li>
        <p>Lightly oil an 8x8-inch baking dish. </p>
      <li>Whisk the yolks and sugar to make the zabaglione: </li>
        <p>Set a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water to <br> create a double boiler (the bowl should rest on the rim of the <br> pan and the bottom should not touch the surface of the water). </p>
        <p>Whisk together the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of the <br> sugar in the bowl. Continue whisking until the <br> sugar has dissolved, the mixture has increased slightly in volume, and it looks light <br> yellow color. Not sure? Rub a little of the mixture between two fingers (it will be warm, but not too hot to touch) â€“ it should feel <br> smooth and silky; if you feel any sugar granules, keep whisking. </p>

      <li>Add in the rum:</li>
      <p>Gradually whisk in 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the rum and <br> continue whisking rapidly over the double boiler for about 10 <br> minutes, until the mixture is thick, foamy, and very pale yellow. <br> (You can also use a hand mixer for this step, if you prefer.) </p>
      <li>Whip the mascarpone and cream:</li>
      <li>Mix the whipped cream and the zabaglione: </li>
      <li>Make the coffee dipping liquid for the ladyfingers: </li>
      <li>Assemble the tiramisu: </li>
      <li>Chill the tiramisu: </li>
      <li>Serve: </li>
